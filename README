1. Minimum PHP 5.1, prefer 5.3. Support for PHP 4.x is not guranteed
2. Moved license boilerplate to a separate file
3. Added PDO based DB connection class
4. Refactored ext/mysql style function calls into PDO paramterized queries (full version only)
5. Added query counter (full version only)
6. Formatting: cuddled if/else and function calls
7. Route class and RouteOptions, will allow for much easier route selection in future

Route selection - notes
----------------------
* current implementation fixme: only considers hopcount after changeovers, optimal hopcount (with higher changeovers) never get seen
* current implementation fixme: as expected, order of magnitude higher queries per level (~50 queries to ~750 queries from level2 to level 3)
* current implementation fixme: hardcoded changeover points
* current implementation fixme: changeover point selection is invariant, regardless of bus route selected
* current implementation fixme: will probably not scale to 4, 5 changeovers [perhaps this isn't necessary?]

options
--------
* classical routing will probably work, but will (at least initially) scale worse than the existing setup
* A* - will need modifications to prevent zigzag, better weighting system required
* Adjacency lists/Adjacency matrix of locations
* Kosaraju modifier (to accommodate hopcounts/weights) to DFS
* Spanning trees: MST with Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms (probably not a great choice, though)
* Djikstra/critical path method
* Bellman/Ford - need to check if this works in less than exponential time
